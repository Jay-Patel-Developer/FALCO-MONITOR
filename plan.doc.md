# Falco Monitor: Project Plan

## Overview
Falco Monitor is a full-stack, cloud-native security monitoring application that demonstrates real-time detection, alerting, and visualization using open source Falco. The project is designed to showcase expertise in Go and Python backend development, TypeScript/React frontend, distributed systems, and cloud-native best practices—directly aligning with Sysdig’s mission and job requirements.

---

## Objectives
- Ingest Falco alerts in real-time (via gRPC output)
- Store, process, and enrich alerts efficiently
- Provide a React + TypeScript frontend for visualization, rule management, and system health
- Ensure scalability, reliability, and testability
- Demonstrate best practices in design, testing, and cloud-native development
- Integrate with container and cloud environments (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Highlight modular, extensible, and well-documented code

---

## Architecture
### 1. Falco Alert Ingestion
- **Input Methods:**
  - Falco gRPC output (real-time streaming, enabled in `falco.yaml`)
- **Backend Services:**
  - **Go**: Core API server, gRPC client for Falco, REST/gRPC endpoints, orchestration
  - **Python**: Analytics, enrichment, and scripting for advanced event processing
  - **Inter-process communication**: gRPC or REST between Go and Python components
  - **Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all backend services

### 2. Data Storage
- **Database:**
  - PostgreSQL or MongoDB for alert storage (optional for MVP)
  - Schema optimized for querying by time, severity, rule, etc.

### 3. Frontend
- **React + TypeScript Application:**
  - Real-time dashboard for Falco alerts and system health
  - Filtering, searching, and alert details
  - Rule management UI (enable/disable/update rules)
  - Responsive, modern UI (Material-UI or similar)
  - Component and E2E tests

### 4. Cloud-Native & DevOps
- **Containerization:** Docker for all services
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes manifests for deployment (optional for MVP)
- **Cloud Ready:** Configs for AWS/GCP/Azure
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing and builds

### 5. Testing & Quality
- **Backend:** Unit, integration, and API contract tests (Go, Python)
- **Frontend:** Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (E2E)
- **Linting/Static Analysis:** Across all languages
- **Documentation:** Professional README, architecture docs, usage guides

---

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Security Event Dashboard**
  - Live stream of Falco alerts
  - Filtering, searching, and tagging of events
  - Severity and rule-based grouping
- **Rule Management**
  - View, enable/disable, and update Falco rules from the UI
  - Push rule changes to Falco via backend API
- **System Health & Metrics**
  - Display Falco and system health (webserver, gRPC, plugin status)
  - Resource usage and performance metrics
- **Integrations**
  - Support for Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes event sources
  - Optional: Cloud provider metadata enrichment (AWS/GCP/Azure)
- **Testing & Quality**
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests (Go, Python, React)
  - Linting and static analysis

---

## Milestones
1. **Project Setup**
   - Repo structure, Docker, CI/CD skeleton
2. **Backend MVP**
   - Enable Falco gRPC output in `falco.yaml`
   - Implement Go backend gRPC client to subscribe to Falco alerts
   - Python analytics/enrichment service
   - WebSocket or REST API to forward alerts to frontend
   - (Optional) Database integration for alert storage
3. **Frontend MVP**
   - React + TypeScript dashboard, alert list, details view
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket or gRPC-Web
   - Rule management UI
4. **Cloud/K8s Deployment**
   - Dockerize, write K8s manifests, test on Minikube/kind
5. **Testing & Documentation**
   - Unit/integration/E2E tests, user/developer docs
6. **Polish & Share**
   - UI/UX improvements, performance, share with Sysdig

---

## Success Criteria
- End-to-end demo: Falco alert triggers → appears in dashboard in real-time
- Clean, maintainable codebase with tests
- Cloud/K8s deployable
- Professional documentation (README, architecture, usage)
- Ready to discuss design, trade-offs, and improvements in interviews

---

## Stretch Goals
- **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy to a managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS/GKE/AKS)
- **User Management:** Basic authentication and RBAC for dashboard
- **Alert Integrations:** Slack, email, or webhook notifications
- **Advanced Analytics:** Anomaly detection or ML-based event scoring

---

## Next Steps
- Enable Falco’s gRPC output in `falco.yaml`
- Implement Go backend gRPC client to subscribe to Falco alerts
- Add Python analytics/enrichment service
- Forward alerts to frontend via WebSockets (or gRPC-Web)
- Scaffold React frontend for real-time updates and rule management
- Iterate towards MVP

---

## Notes
- Optional: Add authentication, RBAC, multi-tenancy for bonus points
- Optional: Integrate with Sysdig APIs or cloud provider event sources
